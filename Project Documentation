# DevOps Technical Exercise - Project Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the DevOps technical exercise completed as part of the interview process. The exercise involved the deployment of a hub-and-spoke network architecture on Microsoft Azure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. This documentation aims to give insights into the solution provided and its key components.

## Exercise Description

The primary objective of this exercise was to create an Azure network infrastructure with the following components:

1. **Hub Virtual Network**
2. **Two Spoke Virtual Networks**
3. **VNet Peering between Hub and Spokes**
4. **Azure Firewall in the Hub VNet**
5. **Private Endpoint**
6. **Application Gateway with Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
7. **Storage Accounts for Hosting Static Websites**

## Solution Description

### Hub-and-Spoke Architecture

We implemented a hub-and-spoke network architecture to achieve network segmentation and isolation. The Hub VNet serves as the central hub for managing network traffic and hosting shared resources, while the Spoke VNets connect to the Hub and are used for specific regional purposes.

### Network Security

Azure Firewall was deployed in the Hub VNet to control inbound and outbound traffic, ensuring network-level security. This firewall helps protect the entire network infrastructure from unauthorized access and threats.

### Private Connectivity

Private endpoints were established to enable secure access to Azure services over a private connection. This enhances security by eliminating exposure to the public internet while accessing Azure resources.

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)

The Application Gateway with Web Application Firewall (WAF) was configured to provide high availability and protection for web applications. It can route traffic to different regions and mitigate web-based threats effectively.

### Static Website Hosting

Storage accounts were created in both Spoke VNets to host static websites. These storage accounts are optimized for high availability and support HTTPS traffic exclusively.

## Implementation Details

- **Parameters and Variables**: The provided ARM template utilizes parameters and variables for flexibility and reusability. Key parameters include location and resource names.

- **Deployment**: The deployment process was described in the README, which includes modifying parameters and deploying the ARM template using Azure CLI, PowerShell, or the Azure Portal.

## Next Steps for Production Deployment

1. **Define Environments**: Define the different environments where your infrastructure will be deployed, such as development, testing, and production. Each environment may have specific configurations and resources.

2. **Security and Access Control**: Implement appropriate security measures to protect your resources and sensitive data. This includes identity and access management, access policies, and security audits.

3. **Secrets Management**: Utilize a secrets management solution, such as Azure Key Vault, to securely store and manage credentials and secrets used in the pipeline, such as service principal credentials.

4. **Validation and Testing**: Incorporate validation and testing steps in the pipeline to ensure successful deployment and compliance with requirements. This may include integrity, performance, and security testing.

5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring and logging solutions to continuously track the state of the infrastructure and real-time events. Consider using Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics for this purpose.

6. **Notifications and Alerts**: Configure alerts to receive immediate notifications in case of issues or significant changes in the infrastructure. Alerts can be valuable for proactive action.

7. **Infrastructure Versioning**: Consider implementing a version control system for your infrastructure code, making it easy to track changes and revert to previous versions if issues arise.

8. **Change Management**: Establish a change management process that includes review and approval of changes before deployment to the production environment.

9. **Gradual Deployment**: If feasible, consider a gradual deployment approach in production instead of an all-at-once change. This reduces risk and allows for early issue detection.

10. **Detailed Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of your infrastructure, pipeline, and deployment processes. This is essential for future maintenance and for the team managing the production infrastructure.

11. **Monitoring and Optimization**: Continuously monitor performance and efficiency in the production infrastructure. Make adjustments and optimizations as needed to ensure optimal performance and controlled costs.

12. **Security Assessment**: Conduct regular security assessments and patch updates to protect your infrastructure against known threats.
